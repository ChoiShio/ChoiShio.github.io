I have just decided my research topic!

It is "Sound Source Separation based on Audio-Visual Multimodal Learning".

There are the following things for this task:
- Detection of the objects in video for instance level
- Classification of the sound of them in audio
- Learning the audio-visual model jointly for separation of the sound sources

You can refer to the following figures to understand this task.
